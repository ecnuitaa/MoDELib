	MODEL is a header-only library so there is nothing to install. All you need in order to use MODEL is to copy the 
	folder mmdl somewhere in your include path, typically usr/local/include
	
	\section dependencies Dependencies
	
	MODEL depends on the following external libraries:
	- the c++ standard library
	- the boost library (header only, available at http://www.boost.org/)
	- the Eigen library (header only, available at http://eigen.tuxfamily.org)

  This manual is divided in the following sections:
 
 
 - \subpage linking "Linking Additional Libraries"
 - \subpage return "Return to main page"
 
 
 
 
 
  - Make sure you have first installed correctly the MODEL library ( \ref installation "Installing the MDML Library").
 
 - The MODEL library takes advantage of two other libraries, Eigen3 and BOOST

 \section sec3 Installing Eigen3
 
 - Start by downloading the library from http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/   , and then place the folder named "Eigen" in 
 /usr/local/include/
 
 \section sec4 Installing BOOST
 
 - The library can be found at http://www.boost.org/.  place the folder named "boost" in 
 /usr/local/include/
 
 
 
 To link these two libraries to your C++ project, you have to follow the following steps:
 
 -open from the "Project" menu the "Edit Project Settings" window.
 
 -go to the "Search Paths" section and type in the "Header Search Paths", the path to the folder where you installed your libraries: /usr/local/include/
 
 - Now you can proceed to  \ref tutorial "Tutorial"
