1) CLONE:
hg clone https://model@bitbucket.org/model/model ./Model

2) PUSH changes:
hg push https://model@bitbucket.org/model/model



The idea is that Model/.hgignore does not track Model/docs/????? , which is a repository itself. Doxygen writes in this folder.

1) CLONE
hg clone https://model@bitbucket.org/model/model.bitbucket.org ./HTML

2) RUN Model/docs/doxygen/doxyfile (which has ../../ as source directory and ../HTML as destination directory)

3) PUSH DOCUMENTATION
hg push https://model@bitbucket.org/model/model.bitbucket.org
