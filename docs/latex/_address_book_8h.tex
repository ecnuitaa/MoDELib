\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em \hyperlink{classmodel_1_1_address_book}{Address\+Book} is a class template that stores a static map of pointers to Derived class objects using the \hyperlink{classmodel_1_1_c_r_t_p}{C\+R\+T\+P} pattern. The key in the map is the static\+I\+D. The derived object gains access to the pointers of all the other objects of derived type that are instatiated. The static map is automatically and dynamically updated during construction/destruction of derived objects. A dynamic I\+D into the static vector is also provided. The typical implementation is\+: \end{DoxyCompactList}\item
