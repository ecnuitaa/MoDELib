\hyperlink{classmodel_1_1_address_book}{Address\+Book} is a class template that stores a static map of pointers to Derived class objects using the \hyperlink{classmodel_1_1_c_r_t_p}{C\+R\+T\+P} pattern. The key in the map is the static\+I\+D. The derived object gains access to the pointers of all the other objects of derived type that are instatiated. The static map is automatically and dynamically updated during construction/destruction of derived objects. A dynamic I\+D into the static vector is also provided. The typical implementation is\+:

\begin{DoxyCode}
\textcolor{keyword}{class }Derived : \textcolor{keyword}{public} AddressBook<Derived>\{

\end{DoxyCode}


For multiple inheritance it\textquotesingle{}s usefulto use the following pattern\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
\textcolor{keyword}{template} <\textcolor{keyword}{typename} Derived2>
\textcolor{keyword}{class }Derived1 : \textcolor{keyword}{public} AddressBook<Derived2>\{
...
\};
 
\textcolor{keyword}{class }Derived2 : \textcolor{keyword}{public} Derived1<Derived2>\{
