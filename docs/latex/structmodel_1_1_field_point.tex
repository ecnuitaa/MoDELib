\subsection{Detailed Description}
\subsubsection*{template$<$typename Derived, short unsigned int \+\_\+dim, typename... Field\+Types$>$struct model\+::\+Field\+Point$<$ Derived, \+\_\+dim, Field\+Types $>$}

A class template that contains the underlying Field\+Type data of the Derived particle. 

If M\+P\+I is not used, the data is stored locally in the based class Eigen\+::\+Matrix$<$scalar,rows,cols$>$.

In case that M\+P\+I is used, the underlying data is not stored with the object but is deallocated to a static vector that can efficiently be syncronized using M\+P\+I\+\_\+\+Allgatherv, and conveniently used as an \hyperlink{namespace_eigen}{Eigen} object via the Eigen\+::\+Map class.
