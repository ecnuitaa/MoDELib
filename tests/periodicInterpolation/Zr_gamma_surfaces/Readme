energy.res/energy.new: contains the raw data, directly coming from EAM or ab initio
	They can be plotted with gnuplot script energy.gnu
		gnuplot energy.gnu

interpole.res: Fourier interpolation
	corresponding gnuplot script file: interpole.gnu and projection_interpole.gnu

The Fourier interpolation is obtained with the program 
	fourierInterpolate2D < input.fourier
You need to compile this program in the corresponding subdirectory
The input instructions for this program are in French (sorry), 
but if it is a problem I can tranlate. 
This program simply makes a Fourier transform by Fourier transformation.
Result of the interpolation is written in file interpole.res, 
while the coefficient of the Fourier series are in fourier.res.
This program will lead strange things if you include too many harmonics 
in the Fourier harmonics.  It may be better then to use the program fourierFit2D
which makes a least square fitting. You will have to adapt a little bit the 
file input.dat containing the input parameters.
