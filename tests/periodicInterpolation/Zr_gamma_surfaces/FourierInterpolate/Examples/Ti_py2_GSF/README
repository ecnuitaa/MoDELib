We want to interpolate the data in file energy.res with 2D FFT taking care of symmetries.
Lines in input data file energy.res can be commented with #

Command:
fourierFit2D_sym

You need to enter then the information contained in file input.fourierFit2D_sym,
or you can directly launch 
fourierFit2D_sym < input.fourierFit2D_sym

The symmetry operations are described in file input.symmetrize.



Output files:
energy.interpole: interpolated function on the desired grid.
fourier.coef: coefficients of the 2D Fourier series



Post-treatment:
You can plot the result using the gnuplot script energy.gnu
command: gnuplot energy.gnu
ouput postscript image: energy.eps
