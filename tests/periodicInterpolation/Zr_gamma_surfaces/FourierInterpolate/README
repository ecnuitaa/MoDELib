List of programs
================

* fourierInterpolate1D
Interpolate with a 1D Fourier series a function of one variable. 
The dataset to interpolate needs to be on a regular grid

* fourierInterpolate1D_linear
Same as fourierInterpolate1D but a linear function is added to the periodic function

* fourierFit1D
Interpolate with a 1D Fourier series a function of one variable. 
A least square fit is used to build the interpolation, 
so the dataset does not need to be on a regular grid

* fourierInterpolate2D
Interpolate with a 2D Fourier series a function of two variables. 
The dataset to interpolate needs to be on a regular grid

* fourierFit2D
Interpolate with a 2D Fourier series a function of two variables. 
A least square fit is used to build the interpolation, 
so the dataset does not need to be on a regular grid

* fourierFit2D_sym
Same as fourierFit2D_sym but we can enforce some symmetry operations
on the 2D Fourier series

*fourierMinPath2D
An example of a program using the 2D FFT interpolation built either with 
fourierFit2D or fourierFit2D_sym.
The program looks for the minimum energy path on the energy surface.
