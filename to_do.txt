NEW LOOP_NETWORK CODE
- Finish PeriodicBC
- Mobility specific to slip system
- Make Loops with |Burgers|>1 sessile
- Rework crossslip
- Microstructure generator with different distributions
- DDvtk movies
- DDvtk cannot interrupt autoplay
- New time integrator
- DipolarMicrostructureGenerator for Bcc/Hcp
- Natural Cubic Splines
- Merge loops on same plane
- Non-convex domains (each grain convex?)
- Documentation
- Hoffman2 documentation (see emails between Yinan and Raffaella)
- SpaceDecompositin based on KD-tree
- Replace const static with constexpr in LagrangeElement and DiscontinuousLagrange http://www.cplusplus.com/forum/general/121300/
- Make all quadratures constexpr
- Use constexpr std::array for quadrature
- Don’t multipole expand displacement. Use loop structure to compute it
- Make LatticePlane and LatticePlaneBase templated by dim
- mesh search algorithms for non-convex domains (e.g. foam)
- GPU computation
- Implement cracks
- DislocationSegment::is_boundarySegment() must use mid point (not normals) to push segments to corners
- Assemble and solve is taking too long (> particle interaction). Can we assemble scalar system of equations? Null-space solver?
- display help in DDvtk
- Convex decomposition of Mesh (http://masc.cs.gmu.edu/wiki/ACD)
- Non convex domains changes: barycentric search algorithm, PlaneMeshIntersection::planeMeshIntersection, virtual segments, initial microstructure
- Use CGAL
- SplineIntersection::planePlaneType uses the wrong tolerance (10x)
- If T0=0 or T1=0, then rl(0)=0/0=NaN !!!!! This is not true since rl still tends to a finite vector. Remove class Parametric curve and implement special case of rl at 0 and 1 for vanishing nodal tangents
- cellSize should depend on applied load. Or better the number of cell neighbors used in each cell should depend on the applied stress to that cell
- Implement operator << SpatialCell
- iterate on JunctionFormation until no junctions if found
- iterate on Remesh
- Optimize Remesh
- clean up BoundingLineSegments. Use LineSegment class instead of pair<VectorDim,VectorDim>
- DislocationJunctions: IF CONTRACT DID NOT HAPPEN REMOVE NODES THAT WERE CREATED BY EXPANSION. STORE IDS IN CONTAINER AND THEN REMOV
- Form GB junctions??
- Stress field is absent in some segments for evaluation of transmission criterion
- bring createNodeList to TrialFunction (node lists are in created to set a dirichlet condition for a particular trial function). Make fe const in trial function.
- add FiniteElement::mesh2femNode(const size_t& meshNodeID)
- IMPLEMENT FUNCTION TO DEFINE THE OUT-DIR FOR EACH LOOP LINK. THIS IS BASED ON THE INTERSECTION OF A SEM-ILINE WITH THE LOOP IN THE PLANE. NUMBER OF INTERSECTIONS TELLS INSIDE OR OUTSIDE
- junction detection using linking number
- topological operation to split a node into many nodes, one per loops connected. Similar to “remove”. This is actually a remove followed by many expansions
-THE PROBLEM IS THAT IF F FOR A NODE IS ZERO, THE VELOCITY IS NOT ZERO, THIS IS WHY PURE ZERO-B NODES MOVE
- RELATED TO THIS, WE NEED TO MERGE LOOPS ON THE SAME PLANE
-THERE IS ALSO A PROBLEM WITH THE TRIANGULATION FOR CROSSING LOOPS
- We should always assume that velocity within a segment is interpolated linearly, so no need for complex assembly construction for curved segments (i.e. matrix Mseg is identity)
- DislocationJunctionFormation::glissileJunctions is not forming <100>{110} and <110>{110} types glissile loops, because it is only looping iver the <111>{110} types 

ISSUES:
- Should form finite length junctions
- When remesh removes a node, part of the slipped area is removed. This should be accounted in the plastic strain rate, but is is not. As a consequence, when a new node is added, plastic strain rate oscillates about a non-zero mean value.
- Boundary length does not account for overlapping loops on the bonudary. We should use Loops objects to compute length
